*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison*

These websites are all relevant comparisions because, besides a few differences, they all seek to do the same thing - appeal to their customers by providing a quality stay. The hope for these companies is that what would normally just be a place to sleep becomes a unique experience that keeps the customer coming back for more. 

*List at least 10 product features*

1.) A user can easily change currancy
2.) A user can select from a list of ammenities to add to their search
3.) A user can select "pet-friendly" stays
4.) You can further narrow search results by selecting "guest favorites" or "superhosts"
5.) You can search by dimensions (# of bedrooms or bathrooms)
6.) A user can filter by host language
7.) Near their stay location, a customer can look up nearby experiences and book through the airbnb website
8.) Airbnb now has online experiences that can be accessed regardless of location
9.) Guests can direct message hosts and/customer support
10.) When selecting dates, guests can choose whether or not to be flexible in how many days they stay. This allows them to see more booking options at a larger range of prices.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that there was a desparity between users who aren't sure of their destination and the website's ablity to provide quick and easy information that would assist users in narrowing their search. For example, both users felt as though the search function, specifically with the map, was overwhelming and cumbersome. It did not allow them to get a snapshot, or preview, of any particular area thereby forcing them to either open every destination on the map or to know exactly what area they wanted to stay in. The research further suggests that users want an easy to navigate feature that provides a quick visual synopsis of both the locations and the types of stays that are available.
